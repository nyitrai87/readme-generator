# README Generator

## Description
This app makes it easier for developers to create README.md files to their projects. By using it you don't need to know the Markup language, just answer a few questions displayed on the console and the file will be generated, ready to use in your GitHub repo.

## Installation
The app itself doesn't require installation, however to be able to use it [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) needs to be installed on your computer.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Execute `npm install` in the project folder to get the necessary dependencies.
3. Execute `node index.js` to launch the README Generator.
4. Answer the questions. Some of them are mandatory to answer, while the others if you leave them blank, "N/A" will be displayed in the generated file.
5. You can find the generated README.md in the `output` folder within the project folder.
